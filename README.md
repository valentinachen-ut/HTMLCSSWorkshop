# HTML/CSS Workshop
A simple tutorial created for an HTML/CSS workshop by Sense Corp. The goal is provide an overview and background for HTML/CSS and provide basic exercises for students to solve in very limited time.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Things you will need to install the software and how to install them.
* Editors - you'll need an editor/IDE to edit your code.

   *   Notepad - As basic as you can get. It's okay to use, but will not provide as many features as editors below.

   *   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) - pretty popular option, very clean interface. 

   *   [Atom](https://atom.io) - very customizable with a huge plugin library and open source so it's always being improved.

   *   [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) - one step up from Notepad, but pretty decent. Has code highlighting and nothing else too fancy.

* Browser - you'll need a browser to display your code. Most people already have one, but alas, here we are.

   *   [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) - We recommend Chrome since it displays HTML and CSS more seamlessly.

   *   [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new) - Another common browser used.
